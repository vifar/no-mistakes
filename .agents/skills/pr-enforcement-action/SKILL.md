**Shared PR-Enforcement Action (`.github/actions/require-no-mistakes`)**

- The shared implementation of the `PR must be raised via no-mistakes` gate is a composite action that lets enforcing repositories replace copied, drift-prone scripts. It verifies the signature line, parses the v1 pipeline-step attestation, binds `head_sha` to the PR head, and requires `review`, `test`, and `document` to be `completed`. Callers pin a release tag or commit SHA, never `@main`, which the judged PR can edit. Per-repo configuration is exemptions only (`exempt-authors`, `exempt-bot-authors`, `exempt-head-branches`); which steps are required is deliberately not an input, so no caller can weaken the gate while still reporting the same check name. The action README owns usage; `CONTRIBUTING.md` owns the contributor-facing contract.
- This repository's own gate (`.github/workflows/no-mistakes-required.yml`) is a thin caller of the action, pinned at an already-published commit SHA. GitHub downloads `uses:` at job setup, so the pin must always name a ref that already carries the action. That pin IS the self-certification guard: a PR editing the action is fully tested on its own head (the Go tests execute the working-tree `verify.py`) while the required check judging it runs the published pinned copy, so the change cannot rewrite its own judge. Bumping the pin is a separate deliberate PR.
- This repo's automation exemptions stay in the job-level `if:`, not in `exempt-authors`. An in-job exemption still needs the run to start, and a GITHUB_TOKEN PR's run is created in `action_required` and never starts; the `paths-ignore` entries exist for the same reason. Repos without that constraint should prefer the action's inputs.
- Duplicate step records are LAST-WINS by design (`check_required_steps` in `verify.py`), and a skip-shaped sibling field on a `completed` record is deliberately not inspected. Some pre-migration inline gates were stricter (requiring every record of a name to be `completed`); that strictness is explicitly NOT the standard, and relaxing to last-wins on migration is the intended outcome, not a regression. Do not "harden" this without an owner decision.
- All callers use the T2 trigger set (`opened`, `edited`, `synchronize`, `reopened`). Since the pre-push attestation change (#994), `synchronize` is the event that judges a pipeline-pushed head, so it is restored rather than dropped after `head_sha` binding.
- Migrating a repository is rarely a one-file swap. Repos whose tests extract and execute the inline `run:` block (an `extractGateScript()` helper and its gate test) break at import once the block is gone, and repo-level `AGENTS.md` notes that tell agents to hand-copy the gate from a sibling repository must be rewritten - that copying is the drift the shared action exists to remove.
- Regressions: `require_no_mistakes_action_test.go` executes `verify.py` the way a runner does (verdicts, exemption surface, event-payload binding); `workflow_no_mistakes_required_test.go` owns the CALLER - immutable-SHA pin, single delegating step, exemptions, triggers, concurrency identity, fork boundary - and drives the real action through the event payload.
